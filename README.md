# DSC_EDA_Task
This task is a Exploratory Data Analysis Project on a Student dataset consisting of multiple features like IQ,Hours studied,Part time jobs,Study Hour groups.
The labels of this dataset includes the marks of Physics,Chemistry and Mathematics.
The modules used in this project are:
pandas and numpy for Analysing the data.
matplotlib and seaborn for Visualising the data.
sklearn for training and validating a Linear Regression model.

The dataset seems to be highly fabricated and unrealistic, with randomised values. This is why no trends can be observed in the data and the model has a negative accuracy score. None of the features relate to each other or any of the labels. Even while plotting the graphs for the EDA, they came out to be very unrealistic and showed no comparison or relation between any of the data.
